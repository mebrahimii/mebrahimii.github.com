    <b>Provided files:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="print_hardcoded_strings.asm"><code>print_hardcoded_strings.asm</code></a></li>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
	<br/>
    <h4><b>Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with a QtSpim Tutorial</b></h4>
	<p>
      Read and familiarize yourslf with a short <a href="https://ecs-network.serv.pacific.edu/ecpe-170/tutorials/qtspim-tutorial">QtSpim tutorial</a>.
      This tutorial discusses how to open and run MIPS assembly code from within <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/">QtSpim</a>, 
	  which you will be doing frequently over the next few weeks. Additionally, the following resources will be useful:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf">MIPS reference card</a>, which covers the bulk of 
		the instructions available on MIPS.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/secondyear/spim/node8.html">QtSpim system calls</a>, which cover the various operations QtSpim 
		can perform when the <code>syscall</code> instruction is executed.
      </li>
    </ul>
	<h4><b>Step 2: Download all Required Files</b></h4>
		<p>
		  Download all the files listed under <b>Provided files</b> above.
		  These <b>must</b> all be placed in the same folder/directory, and it should be someplace that you can easily access later.
		  For example, these could go on either a personal laptop, the Z drive, or a personal USB drive.
		</p>
	<br/>	
	<h4><b>Step 3: Edit <a href="print_hardcoded_strings.asm"><code>print_hardcoded_strings.asm</code></a></b></h4>
		<p>
      Open the <a href="print_hardcoded_strings.asm"><code>print_hardcoded_strings.asm</code></a> file, and open it up in a text editor of your choice.
      Note that word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs) will probably <b>not</b> work for this purpose, as you must save your file as plain text.
      You must write MIPS assembly code which, when run under QtSpim, will print the following:
    </p>
<pre>
first
second
</pre>
    <p>
      <a href="print_hardcoded_strings.asm"><code>print_hardcoded_strings.asm</code></a> contains comments which further describe exactly how you can go about this.
      As a hint, your code will look similar to <a href="../../lecture/week_3/hello_world.asm"><code>hello_world.asm</code></a>.
    </p>
	<br/
    <h4><b>Step 4: Edit <a href="print_not.asm"><code>print_not.asm</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Open the <a href="print_not.asm"><code>print_not.asm</code></a> file, and open it up in a text editor of your choice.
      Note that word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs) will probably <b>not</b> work for this purpose, as you must save your file as plain text.
      You must write MIPS assembly code which will read an integer from the user, and will then print (in order):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The integer</li>
      <li>A newline character</li>
      <li>The bitwise negation (NOT) of the integer (with the help of the <code>nor</code> instruction)</li>
      <li>A newline character</li>
    </ol>
      Example output of this code is shown below, where <code>63</code> was the input integer:
    </p>
<pre>
63
-64
</pre>
    <p>
      <a href="print_not.asm"><code>print_not.asm</code></a> contains comments which further describe exactly how you can go about this.
      As a hint, your code will look similar to <a href="../../lecture/week_3/read_and_print_int.asm"><code>read_and_print_int.asm</code></a>.
    </p>
	<br/>	
 <h4><b>Step 5: Edit <a href="binops.asm"><code>binops.asm</code></a></b></h4>
	<p>
      Open the <a href="binops.asm"><code>binops.asm</code></a> file, and open it up in a text editor of your choice.
      Note that word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs) will probably <b>not</b> work for this purpose, as you must save your file as plain text.
      You must write MIPS assembly code which will read two integers from the user (hereafter referred to as <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, respectively), 
	  and will then print (in order):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>A + B</code> on its own line</li>
      <li><code>A - B</code> on its own line</li>
      <li><code>A &amp; B</code> (bitwise AND) on its own line</li>
      <li><code>A | B</code> (bitwise OR) on its own line</li>
      <li><code>A ^ B</code> (bitwise XOR) on its own line</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Example output of this code is shown below, which results from reading in <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> as the provided integers:
    </p>
<pre>
9
-1
4
5
1
</pre>
    <p>
      <a href="binops.asm"><code>binops.asm</code></a> contains comments which further describe exactly how you can go about this.
      As a hint, your code will look similar to the basic examples under the week 3 materials..
    </p>

	<h4><b>Step 6: Turn in Your Answers Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></b></h4>
	<p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 122L class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Lab 3&rdquo;.
      From here, you can upload your <code>.s</code> files.
      Specifically, you must turn in the following three files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>print_hardcoded_strings.asm</code></li>
      <li><code>print_not.asm</code></li>
      <li><code>binops.asm</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> 
	  and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other three files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
    </p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT: Your Code Must Run Under QtSpim</h3>
    <p>
      The code you submit <b>must</b> run under QtSpim without modification.<b>Code with syntax errors gets an automatic 0</b>.
      If you can't get your code to do the right thing, it's better to submit code that runs but does the wrong thing.

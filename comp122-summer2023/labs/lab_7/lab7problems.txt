Lab 7 Problems: Boolean Formulas and Introductory Circuits

---TRUTH TABLES---

Each of the following questions requires you to fill in a
truth table for a given operation / Boolean formula.

1.) When adding single bits, we usually also consider
a carry-in bit, as well as a carry-out bit. This is
visually represented below:

      Cin
      A
+     B
-------
Cout  R

That is, adding the bits `A` and `B` together with a
carry-in bit `Cin` produces a result bit `R` and a
carry-out bit `Cout`.

Write the truth table corresponding to the above
inputs and outputs below. The first four have already
been completed for you.

    Cin A B | Cout R
____________________
1a) 0   0 0 | 0    0
1b) 0   0 1 | 0    1
1c) 0   1 0 | 0    1
1d) 0   1 1 | 1    0
1e) 1   0 0 |
1f) 1   0 1 |
1g) 1   1 0 |
1h) 1   1 1 |



2.) This question builds somewhat on top of the previous
question.  Instead of adding single bits at a time, let's
scale this up to two bits.  This is visually represented
below:

          Cin
      A1 A0
+     B1 B0
-----------
Cout  R1 R0

For this problem, you are given a carry-in bit `Cin`, as
well as the operands `A` and `B`, just as before. However,
`A` and `B` are now two bits apiece, with `A0` holding
the bit at position 0 and `A1` holding the bit at position
1, and so on. This still produces `R` as a result, though
the result is now two bits large, with `R0` holding the
result value at position 0, and `R1` holding the result
value at position 1.  `Cout` holds the carry-out bit, as
before.

As before, fill in the table below.  Note the ordering
of the inputs. The first few have already been completed
for you.

    Cin A1 B1 A0 B0 | Cout R1 R0
--------------------------------
2a) 0   0  0  0  0  | 0    0  0
2b) 0   0  0  0  1  | 0    0  1
2c) 0   0  0  1  0  | 0    0  1
2d) 0   0  0  1  1  |
2e) 0   0  1  0  0  |
2f) 0   0  1  0  1  |
2g) 0   0  1  1  0  |
2h) 0   0  1  1  1  |
2i) 0   1  0  0  0  |
2j) 0   1  0  0  1  |
2k) 0   1  0  1  0  |
2l) 0   1  0  1  1  |
2m) 0   1  1  0  0  |
2n) 0   1  1  0  1  |
2o) 0   1  1  1  0  |
2p) 0   1  1  1  1  |
2q) 1   0  0  0  0  |
2r) 1   0  0  0  1  |
2s) 1   0  0  1  0  |
2t) 1   0  0  1  1  |
2u) 1   0  1  0  0  |
2v) 1   0  1  0  1  |
2w) 1   0  1  1  0  |
2x) 1   0  1  1  1  |
2y) 1   1  0  0  0  |
2z) 1   1  0  0  1  |
2aa)1   1  0  1  0  |
2ab)1   1  0  1  1  |
2ac)1   1  1  0  0  |
2ad)1   1  1  0  1  |
2ae)1   1  1  1  0  |
2af)1   1  1  1  1  |


3.) Consider the following Boolean formula:

3a) 0 0 0 |

where `R` represents the result of the formula.

    A B C D | R

4p) 1 1 1 1 |

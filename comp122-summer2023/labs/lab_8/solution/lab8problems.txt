Lab 8 Problems: Simplifying Boolean Formulas

---SIMPLIFICATION VIA BOOLEAN ALGEBRA---

1.) For each problem use boolean algebra to simplify the equation.
SHOW YOUR WORK, one step per line.  You should use only variable names,
negation (with `!`), AND (by putting terms next to each other),
OR (with `+`), and parentheses.  In addition, each line should start
with an equal sign (`=`). The first step has been done for you to show how.
As a hint, problem 1c requires De Morgan's Law.

Example) f(Z,Y,X) = !ZY!X + ZY!X + !YX
= (!Z + Z)Y!X + !YX
= Y!X + !YX

1a) f(A,B,C) = !A!BC + A!B!C + !ABC + !AB!C + A!BC
= !A!BC + !ABC + A!B!C + !AB!C + A!BC
= !AC(!B + B) + A!B!C + !AB!C + A!BC
= !AC + A!B!C + !AB!C + A!BC
= !AC + A!B!C + A!BC + !AB!C
= !AC + A!B(!C + C) + !AB!C
= !AC + A!B + !AB!C


1b) f(A,B,C,D) = (A!D + !AC)(!B(C + BD))
= (A!D + !AC)(!BC + !BBD)
= (A!D + !AC)(!BC + D(!BB))
= (A!D + !AC)(!BC + D(false))
= (A!D + !AC)(!BC)
= A!D!BC + !AC!BC
= A!D!BC + !AC!B
= A!BC!D + !A!BC


1c) f(A, B, C) = !(!(A + B)C)
= !(!(A + B)C)
= !(!A!BC)
= !!A + !!B + !C
= A + B + !C

---SIMPLIFICATION VIA KARNAUGH MAPS (K-MAPS)---

Each of these problems starts with a truth table which you may need to
complete.  From there, you need to write an unoptimized sum-of-products
formula, where each product corresponds to a single 1 in the output of
the table, and all the products are summed together.  You will then use
a K-Map to simplify the formula on paper, and then write out the simplified
formula in this file.

2.) In this problem, you are to figure out the logic of the overflow bit
during addition. Remember that the overflow bit is 1 if the result of the
output is out of range for a two's complement representation of the number.
This occurs when the sign of the two inputs are the same, and the sign of the
output differs from that of the inputs.  With this in mind, you can determine
if overflow occurred just by looking at the uppermost bits of the inputs
and the output.
Inputs: R (the leftmost bit of the result),
        A (the leftmost bit of the first operand),
        B (the leftmost bit of the second operand)
Output: V (whether or not overflow occurred)

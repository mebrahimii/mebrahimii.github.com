    <h1>Installing ARMSim#</h1>
	<hr class="star-primary">
    <p>
      The installation process for ARMSim# differs if you're on Windows, Linux, or Mac.
      You can jump to the appropriate set of instructions by clicking the link below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.html#windows">Windows</a></li>
      <li><a href="index.html#linux">Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="index.html#mac">Mac</a></li>
    </ul>

    <a id="windows"></a>
    <h2>Installing on Windows</h2>
		<h3>Step 1: Install .NET Framework 3.5</h3>
		<p>
		  You can skip this step if you already have .NET Framework 3.5 installed.
		  You can download .NET Framework 3.5 directly from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=21">here</a>.
		  Run the downloaded <code>.exe</code> file, which should perform the full install.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2: Install ARMSim#</h3>
		<p>
		  You can download and install ARMSim# using <a href="https://connex.csc.uvic.ca/access/content/group/ARMSim/SIMWeb/DownloadARMSimSharp.html">this link</a>.
		  Unzip the zipfile and then run the downloaded <code>.msi</code> file, which should perform the full install.
		  After this install is completed, you should have ARMSim# up and running.
		</p>
	<br/>

    <h2>Installing on Linux</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Install Mono</h3>
    <p>
      You can download Mono <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">here</a>. You may also be able to download Mono via your distribution's package manager.
      I can confirm that the <code>mono-complete</code> package for the Debian distribution will provide everything you need for Mono.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Download and Unzip Slightly Modified ARMSim#</h3>
    <p>
      Download the zipfile <a href="armsim_linux.zip">here</a>. Unzip the zipfile as you normally would in some location you can easily access.
      The rest of these instructions assume you unzipped this in <code>/home/myself/comp122</code>, resulting in a <code>armsim</code> 
	  folder being created underneath <code>comp122</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Run ARMSim# with Mono</h3>
    <p>
      Open a terminal window. Change to the directory that contains your unzipped ARMSim#.
      For example, if you saved this in <code>/home/myself/comp122</code>, you should issue the following command:
    </p>
<pre>
cd /home/myself/comp122/armsim
</pre>
    <p>
      From here, you should be able to run ARMSim# with:
    </p>
<pre>
mono ARMSim.exe
</pre>
    <p>
      Every time you run ARMSim# in the future, you will need to follow this step (3). You only ever need to install Mono and unzip ARMSim# once.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <a id="mac"></a>
    <h2>Installing on Mac</h2>
    <p>
      While you can follow the Linux instructions on your Mac and they will appear to work, ARMSim# will not be runnable in the end.
      ARMSim# instead will crash each time you run it. (If you see otherwise, let me know, as I still don't know why this is.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this problem, I've setup a virtual machine image which already has ARMSim# installed.
      The virtual machine acts as a self-contained computer (specifically a Linux-based computer) that already has ARMSim# installed.
      This approach can be used on both Windows and Linux as well as Mac, but it's probably easier to use the Windows/Linux-specific instructions if you can use them.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Install VirtualBox</h3>
    <p>
      VirtualBox is software that emulates a computer within a computer. You can download it <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">here</a>.
      Be sure to pick &ldquo;OS X hosts&rdquo; in the menu, which will download a Mac-specific version of VirtualBox.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Download a Custom Virtual Machine Image</h3>
    <p>
      Download the machine image <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a719v7zhrsjp1k5/armsim.ova?dl=0">here</a> (<b>warning:</b> 
	  this file is 1.57 GB in size, so the download may take awhile).
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Import the Virtual Machine Image</h3>
    <p>
      Open VirtualBox. Go to <code>File -> Import Appliance</code>, then choose the file you downloaded in the previous step.
      Accept all the default settings, and click &ldquo;Import&rdquo;. It may take several minutes for VirtualBox to complete the import.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Run the Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>
      If the import in the previous step was successful, you will see <code>armsim</code> displayed on the left of the VirtualBox window, 
	  along with the word &ldquo;Aborted&rdquo;. While the &ldquo;Aborted&rdquo; part looks scary, 
	  this is ok; this is merely an artifact of how the image was prepared. Click on <code>armsim</code>, then click <code>Start</code> (the green arrow).
      VirtualBox may then ask you about selecting a virtual optical disk file; click <code>Cancel</code> in case this happens.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Login to the Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>
      Eventually you will see a login screen like the one below:
    </p>
    <img src="images/login.png">
    <p>
      You can login to the virtual machine with the following credentials:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Username: <code>student</code></li>
      <li>Password: <code>studentpassword</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (For the Linux-savvy, the password for the <code>root</code> user is <code>rootpassword</code>.)
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Open ARMSim#</h3>
    <p>
      Double-click on the <code>ARMSim.sh</code> file on the desktop. This will load ARMSim#.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 7: Downloading and Editing Files</h3>
    <p>
      While VirtualBox runs in a window, this window is itself a self-contained computer.
      This is a little awkward at first, as you cannot easily do things like copy-and-paste between VirtualBox and anything else (though you can 
	  still copy-and-paste within VirtualBox). It also can be challenging to get files into VirtualBox.
      (For the tech-savvy, you <i>can</i> get these features working, but it requires a significant amount of effort.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For downloading files, the machine image comes complete with its own Web browser (<code>Applications -> Internet -> Firefox ESR</code>).
      <br>
      For editing files, <code>emacs</code> (<code>Applications -> Development -> GNU Emacs 24 (GUI)</code>) has been installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this setup may take some getting used to, this is the exact same setup I use for running ARMSim#.
      It requires some substantial effort, but it's doable. :)

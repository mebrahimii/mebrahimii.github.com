As your software is for Windows only, you need a Compatibility Layer.

On their website, they say they tested it with Mono on Mac OS X. You may be also able to use it on Linux.

The easiest way to do this is to install PlayOnLinux (via the USC or sudo apt-get install playonlinux). PlayOnLinux is a GUI Frontend for the compatibility layer Wine (http://www.winehq.org). Wine itself will download and setup Mono, if needed, as in your case, but Wine provides additional libraries that may be needed to use certain programs.

    Install PlayOnLinux and open it.
    Install the latest Wine version (Tools -> Manage Wine versions)
    Afterwards click Install in the main window.
    Hit the install software that is not listed in the bottom left corner of the new window.
    Keep the default settings in the wizard and give the path to the Windows Installer (Setup.exe, Setup.msi, whatever)
    Wait for the program to install, then create a shortcut of the executable
    Finish and run the program.

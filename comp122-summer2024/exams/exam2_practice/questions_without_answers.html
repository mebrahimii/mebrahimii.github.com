    <h1>Midterm Review Questions (without Answers)</h1>
    <p>
      The midterm exam will be broken into two components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A written (lecture-based) exam, on Monday, 8/9/2021</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The written portion will require you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand number representation and numeric operations (from the first three labs)</li>
      <li>Answer short-answer questions related to numeric operations and assembly</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      The review below, <b>in addition to everything you wrote for your labs</b>, is intended to be comprehensive.
      All topics which could potentially be on the exam are somehow covered by this review.
    </p>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The leftmost bit of a 32-bit number is in what position?
      </li>
      <li>
        Shifting an unsigned binary number <code>N</code> two positions to the left is equivalent to multipling <code>N</code> by what (in decimal)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Shifting an unsigned binary number <code>N</code> four positions to the right is equivalent to performing truncating division (ignoring the remainder) by what (in decimal)?
      </li>
      <li>
        For ANY unsigned binary number, which bit must you look at in order to determine if the number is odd or even?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is <code>-8</code> in twos complement representation?
        Represent your solution using 8 bits.
      </li>
      <li>
        What is <code>1 + 1</code> with a carry-in bit set?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is <code>1 + 1</code> without a carry-in bit set?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is <code>1 + 0</code> without a carry-in bit set?
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is:
        </p>
<pre>
  11111101
+ 01000101
</pre>
        <p>
          Specify if the result has a carry-out set and if the result sets the overflow bit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is:
        </p>
<pre>
  10010110
- 11101010
</pre>
        <p>
          Specify if the result has a carry-out set and if the result sets the overflow bit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider an unknown binary number <code>N</code>.
        Using only bitwise operations and bitmasks, give an expression that will produce <code>N</code>, <i>except</i> that bit 7 is guaranteed to be one.
        Express any bitmasks using 2-digit hexadecimal.
      </li>
      <li>
        While this isn't a review question, be familiar with the <a href="../../lecture/week_2/floating_point_interconversions.html">process to convert 
		between binary and decimal floating point representations</a>.
